# Cloud-Resume-Challenge

<h2>Description</h2>
The Cloud Resume Challenge is all about showcasing your abilities in designing, building, and deploying a modern web application using cloud technologies. The goal is simple: create a personal resume website that highlights your skills, experience, and projects, and then deploy it using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or GCP. For my project, I chose to go with AWS.
